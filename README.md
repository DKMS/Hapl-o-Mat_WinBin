# Hapl-o-MatGUI v1.0.1K Windows binary version

## General information:
Hapl-o-MatGUI is a graphical user interface as optional extention for [Hapl-o-Mat](https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat) . Hapl-o-Mat is software for haplotype inference via an expectation-maximization algorithm. It supports processing and resolving various forms of HLA genotype data.

The Hapl-o-MatGUI v1.0.1K Windows binary version contains both, Hapl-o-MatGUI and Hapl-o-Mat and has no further dependencies.

## The latest version:
The latest version of Hapl-o-MatGUI Windows binary version can be found on the Github server under <https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat_WinBin> .
So far, we do not provide a Linux installer. If you want to use Hapl-o-Mat via the Hapl-o-MatGUI on Linux, please consider to download the Hapl-o-MatGUI python source code from  <https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat_GUI> in addition to [Hapl-o-Mat](https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat) .

## Dependencies
The Hapl-o-MatGUI v1.0.1K Windows binary version contains both, Hapl-o-MatGUI and Hapl-o-Mat and has no further dependencies.
 
## Installation and Setup:
Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/DKMS/Hapl-o-Mat_WinBin) to a suitable place on your computer.
Execute Hapl-o-MatGUI_V1.0.1KSetup.exe in the Hapl-o-MatGui folder and follow the instructions. You will be asked to choose a destination folder that will contain all program files.
Hapl-o-MatGUI will be added to your start menu.

Alternatively, you can execute Hapl-o-Mat without the GUI by command line interface. For information on how to proceed, please follow the guide [detailledGettingStartedWindows](Hapl-o-Mat/detailledGettingStartedWindows.pdf). You can skip the compilation because you have already downloaded a compiled Hapl-o-Mat version.

## Uninstall options:
In order to uninstall the downloaded Hapl-o-MatGUI Windows binary version, it is sufficient to remove the entire program folder.
If you have installed Hapl-o-MatGUI to a different location on your computer, you have the following uninstall options:

 * Uninstall GUI by executing the uninstall.exe file in the GUI program folder
 * Deleting the GUI program folder will remove Hapl-o-MatGUI entirely.
